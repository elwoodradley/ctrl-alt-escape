            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Luke! I spent 8 years in the Air Force as a part of Security Forces, where I had the incredible opportunity to travel the world and meet amazing people. In 2017 I decided to leave the Air Force and move back home to be closer to my family.</p>
            <p>Since returning, I've been working as a civilian with the Air Force in a Civil Engineering unit. While I enjoy my work, I've always been fascinated by technology and decided to finally use my GI Bill to pursue a degree in cybersecurity. During my studies, I discovered a real passion for development—building websites, learning programming languages, and creating projects.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm shifting my focus and working toward a career as a software engineer. I built this website as my first real project to showcase what I hope are some solid beginner skills. It also serves as a creative space where I can share my thoughts on things I enjoy in life, like books, gaming, tech, and running—even if no one ends up reading it!</p>
